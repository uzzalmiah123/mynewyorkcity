        <p>According to <a href="https://www.nycgo.com/boroughs-neighborhoods/staten-island">NYC The Official Quide</a> "Visitors shouldn’t miss the opportunity to explore Staten Island, renowned for its museums, historic landmarks, beaches and parkland—including the City’s largest forest preserve in the Staten Island Greenbelt. Reach NYC’s southernmost borough on a free ride aboard the Staten Island Ferry, an attraction in its own right. Take in a baseball game at Richmond County Bank Ballpark; experience a slice of colonial life at Historic Richmond Town; and visit Snug Harbor Cultural Center & Botanical Garden, with exhibits that pay tribute to local maritime heritage.".</p>
        <p> In my won exprence I visited in Staten Island two times. Staten Island is a beautiful place I have visited. I visited with my school friends and with my family. When I visited the first time I never saw a ferry like that. At that time I'm so excited to visit every day because the ferry is free.    . </p>
